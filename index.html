        <h3><a target = '_blank' href="maps/bus_stop_locations.pdf">Bus Stops In Oakland, CA: Open Steet Map Data vs. AC Transit Data</a></h3>
        <p>This map shows areas of Oakland, CA within one-half mile of a bus stop.  The impetus for this map was to see what gaps existed between Open Street Map and a potenitally more detailed data set like the one from the AC Transit Agency.  QGIS along with the QuickOSM plugin, SpatialLite Database, and the buffer analysis tool were used to create this map.</p>

        <p>This map shows the percentage of renter occupied units in Richmond, California that are Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) units. HCV data was downloaded from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's eGIS website. Median household income data was downloaded from the United States Census Bureau's American Fact Finder website and gathered from the American Community Survey 2010-2014 5-year estimates. Median household income data, expressed in 2014 inflation adjusted dollars, were included to give a better idea about what kind of neighborhoods HCV units are in and can also serve as a possible guide as to how exclusionary a neighborhood may be. CARTO was used to create this web map.</p>

        <p>This map shows parcels of land that are now owned by the City of Richmond that were formerly owned by the Successor Agency to the Redevelopment Agency and their proximity to AC transit bus stop locations. All the information for the parcels was obtained from Richmond's Long Range Property Management Plan document. Parcel polygon data was downloaded from the Contra Costa County Mapping Information Center. Bus stop location data was downloaded from the AC Transit Data Resource Center. Parcel Locations layer will dissolve as you zoom in and the bus stop locations will become visible.  All bus stop locations on this map are within 400 meters (1/4 mile) of the parcels. A distance of 400 meters was used since this is a reasonable walking distance for most people.  This was created in CARTO and then Leaflet was used for a more controlled way of displaying the map.</p>
